# DSA Practice Repository

This repository is a personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems that I solve during my practice journey. It will be updated regularly as I learn and implement new concepts.

### 1. Palindrome Checker

**Description**:  
Checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, number, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam", "121").

**Logic**:
- Use two pointers: one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the string.
- Compare the characters at both pointers.
- Move the pointers towards the center.
- If all corresponding characters match, the string is a palindrome.
